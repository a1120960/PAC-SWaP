Portable Atomic Clocks - Size, Weight and Power


# PURPOSE
- This repository is inteneded to be a resource for those interested in the growing world of portable atomic clocks. Specifically looking at the barriers to deployment: the Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) of the clock, and how this affects clock performance.

## SWaP considerations
For clarification on how I have arrived at each metric.
1. Size: Choice of volume units is arbitrary, but herein I have used the unts of cm<sup>3</sup>. Total size includes everything required for actual operation.  
2. Weight: Units of kgs. I have used the weight of the entire device. Everything required for actual operation
3. Power: Units of Watts. I have used the power the entire device. Everything required for actual operation


# DISCLAIMER
- I dont claim that this is a comprehensive database of every single device, however I plan to keep it updated as new devices/results are published/announced. As well as adding anything current or from the past that I may have missed.


# DATA and PLOTTING
- All data is contained in the SWAP_DATA.csv file on the main branch.
- Performance and SWaP numbers have been taken from publications, official websties, or spec sheets. Where this was not possible I contacted the authors or manufacturer. 
- In all cases I have attempted to present the numbers accurately and in good faith.
- If i have made any mistakes, or the numbers need to be updated, please let me know.

- All code for plots is kept in the PLOTTING.ipynb notebook.
- I dont claim to be an expert at python or plotly, so any help or adivce on how to make these plots 'better' would be much appreciated.
