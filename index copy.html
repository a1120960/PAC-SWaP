<p class="text-block"> Precision timekeeping is required for most modern technology, including navigation, syncing of communication networks, financial networks, power networks, the list goes on. 
    Throughout history advances in precision timekeeping gone hand in hand with other technological revolutions.

<p class="text-block"> This plot shows the performance (ADEV) of portable optical clocks as a function of system Size, 
    Weight and Power (SWaP). Performance is shown for 1, 1000 and 10000 second integration times (where available). 
    The general trend is that as SWaP increases, the system gains performance. </p>

<p class="text-block"> Atomic clocks are currently the best source of precision timekeeping. Optical atomic clocks are the best atomic clocks. The very best atomic clocks are confined to the laboratory. Much work has been done to make atomic clocks portable. While microwave atomic clocks have been packaged in a portable form for decades, optical atomic clocks are only just starting to leave the laboratory and get into the field.
    The motivation for creating this plot is to be used as a resource for those interested or involved in precision timing. This plot shows where each clock sits in terms of its performance (instability) vs its Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). The lower the instability, the better the performance. The lower the SWaP, the more portable/deployable the device.
