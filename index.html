<h1 id="PAGE TITLE">Visualizing the SWaP of Portable Atomic Clocks</h1>




<p class="text-block"> 
   Precision timekeeping underpins almost all modern technologies, including navigation, communication network synchronization, financial transactions, and power grid management, among many others. Historically, advancements in precise timekeeping have paralleled almost all technological revolutions. Over the last 80 years, microwave atomic clocks, now essential to our infrastructure, have set the standard for atomic timing precision. This website will document the progress of next-generation optical atomic clocks as they move from the lab to practical applications. The main focus is on the immediate challenges to deploying portable atomic clocks, in particular, their Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements, and how these factors can influence clock performance and deployability.

<h2 id="main-plot">SWaP vs Performance plot</h2>

<p class="text-block"> Atomic clocks are currently the best source of precision timekeeping. 
    Optical atomic clocks are the best atomic clocks, however up until very recently, have been confined to the laboratory. 
    Much work has been done to make atomic clocks portable. 
    While microwave atomic clocks have been packaged in a portable form for decades, 
    optical atomic clocks are only just starting to leave the laboratory and get into the field.
    The motivation for creating this plot is for it to be used as a resource for those interested and or 
    involved in precision timing, and helping to keep track of the work being done 
    to package high performance clocks into a deployable form. 
</p>

<p class="text-block"> The main focus is on the immediate challenges to deploying portable atomic clocks, namely, their size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements, and how these critical factors directly influence clock performance and deployability.
    Beyond this, there will be other considerations relating to the ability to manufacture at scale, cost, accuracy, reliability and other aspects of how clock specifications might meet various use-cases. However, with this resource we focus on the relationship between SWaP and frequency stability.

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The full SWaP plot. Clock performance - ADEV for 1s (coloured diamond), 1000s (grey square) or 10,000s (grey circle) - as a function of total system size, weight and power (cm<sup>3</sup>kgW). Dotted horizontal lines show ADEVs indicative of GNSS timing performance for 1s, 1000s and 10,000s.</p>

<p class="text-block"> <a href="#Fig1">Figure 1</a> is the full SWaP plot. This plot shows the performance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance"> (ADEV)</a> 
    of portable atomic clocks as a function of system Size, 
    Weight and Power (SWaP). Performance is shown for 1, 1000 and 10,000 second integration times (where available). 
    Hovering over a coloured point will reveal more information about the clock:
    Wether it is optical or microwave, commercial or research, its SWaP, its ADEV @ 1second, 
    the manufacturer and or research group, the atomic species, its physics package type and a reference number. This plot conveys all of the information about each clock in a single figure. Further down the page, in subsequent sections, I break the information up into simpler plots that help make some of the general trends more obvious. 
 </p>



<p class="text-block"> 
    In very simple terms, the lower a clocks fractional frequency instability for a given integration time, the better the performance, and the lower the SWaP, the more portable (or deployable) the device.
    It should come as no surprise that the clocks with a larger SWaP also perform the best across all time scales, However for many real world applications the very best performance may not necessary. This is where compromises can be made which allow a reduction of the SWaP of the device. A truly disruptive device would be one which manages to break away from the general diagonal trend and appear in the direction of the lower left corner of the plot.

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Focussed SWaP plot. Performance as a function of SWaP, the focus is now on the region that is populated by devices that have a SWaP value between that of a Playstation and a family fridge. </p>

<p class="text-block"> In <a href="#Fig2">Figure 2</a> we are focused on the clustered region from the full SWaP plot. This is where most of the new devices are appearing. There are now many clocks with similar performance that have a SWaP ranging from that of a Playstation to that of the average sized family fridge. The expectation is this region of the plot will become much more congested in the future, as it represents the realistic trade-off between performance and SWaP a new generation of optical timing devices will target. 
</p>

<p class="text-block"> This highlights the differences in scale between the devices on the plot. One could imagine transporting something the size of a playstation around relatively easily, one person can carry it, but a device on the scale and scale of a fridge presents a different challenge. However, this may not be an issue depending on the application. Some applications might require a device that can be moved in and setup and left to run for an extended time. In which case the extra SWaP may not be an issue. Other applications may demand a device that can be easily moved and operated with minimal delay and setup time.

<h2 id="sub-plots">Breaking down Size, Weight and Power vs Performance</h2>

<p class="text-block"> The units of SWaP end up creating extremely large numbers, so make the true scale of a devices SWaP more accessible, the SWaP from the above plots can be broken down and plotted separately for each of the individual components: Size, Weight and Power. 
</p>

<iframe id = 'Fig3' src="SWAP-PLOT-SLIDERS.html" width="1000" height="650">
</iframe>
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Separately plotting the 1 second ADEV of each clock as a function of its Size, Weight and Power. Units for Size and Weight can be changed using the sliders below each plot </p>

<p class="text-block"> 
    For <a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a> the 1 second ADEV vs each SWaP metric is plotted. While the traces are slightly different for each individual metric, for the most part the clocks show the same distribution for each dimension of SWaP as they do for the total SWaP value. The benefit of visualizing the clocks in this way allows the viewer to more easily picture the scale of each metric and therefore the device. Individually the components of: cm<sup>3</sup>, kg and Watts are easier to relate to than the extremely large numbers associated with the SWaP units of cm<sup>3</sup>kgW.</p>

<p class="text-block"> You can switch between preferred size units of cm<sup>3</sup> and litres, and weight units of kg and pounds (lbs), using the sliders underneath each plot. </p>

<p class="text-block"> <strong>NOTE: the breakdown of SWaP for each clock may not be available, 
    so some clocks that appear on the main plot may not appear in <a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>. Over time I hope to be able to fill in any of the missing data.</strong>

<h2 id="atom-plot">Atomic species</h2>

<iframe id = 'Fig4' src="atom-plot.html" width="1000" height="650">

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Atomic species. Clocks position is ADEV at 1sec as a function of total SWaP. The label for each clock is the atomic species it is based on. The color of the clock depends on whether the clock uses a sample of 'WARM' or 'COLD' atoms (definition below).  </p>

<p class="text-block"> 
    <a href="#Fig4">Figure 4</a> is the full SWaP plot with emphasis on the atomic species (labelled). Rubidium, Ytterbium and Strontium are the most common elements represented. Rubidium (which achieves appropriate vapour pressure at room temperature) lends itself well to the lower SWaP devices, whilst elements such as Ytterbium and Strontium, which require initial heating to 400+C, combined with multiple laser systems, multi stage laser cooling and trapping etc, present a major challenge to package in a compact form. 
</p>
<p class="text-block"> 
    The color of each marker shows wether the clock is based on a sample of'cold' or 'warm' atoms. For simplicity I define a 'cold' atom clock is any clock that uses laser cooling and/or trapping. Currently, this is mainly optical lattice and trapped ion clocks[11-14,19], but also the Muquans[6] cold atom system. A 'warm' atom clock is anything that is not a 'cold' atom clock. The plot suggests that a warm atom clock is easier to package in a small SWaP device, while cold atom devices, which tend to be more complex systems (for the same reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph), have a greater SWaP demand to achieve their higher performance.
