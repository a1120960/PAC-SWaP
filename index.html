<h1 id="PAGE TITLE">Portable Atomic Clocks - Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP)</h1>




<p class="text-block"> 
   Precision timekeeping underpins most modern technologies, including navigation, communication network synchronization, financial transactions, and power grid management, among many others. Historically, advancements in precise timekeeping have paralleled nearly every technological revolution. Over the last 50 years, microwave atomic clocks, now essential to our infrastructure, have set the standard for atomic timing precision. As optical atomic clocks transition from research labs to practical applications, this website aims to serve as a resource tracking this progression as it happens. The main focus is on the immediate challenges to deploying portable atomic clocks, namely, their size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements, and how these critical factors directly influence clock performance and deployability.

<h2 id="main-plot">SWaP vs Performance plot</h2>

<p class="text-block"> This plot shows the performance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance"> (ADEV)</a> 
    of portable optical clocks as a function of system Size, 
    Weight and Power (SWaP). Performance is shown for 1, 1000 and 10000 second integration times (where available). 
    Hovering over a point will reveal more information about the clock:
    Wether it is optical/microwave, commercial/research, its SWaP, its ADEV @ 1second, 
    the manufacturer/research group, the atomic species, and reference.

<p class="text-block"> Atomic clocks are currently the best source of precision timekeeping. 
    Optical atomic clocks are the best atomic clocks. 
    The very best atomic clocks are confined to the laboratory. 
    Much work has been done to make atomic clocks portable. 
    While microwave atomic clocks have been packaged in a portable form for decades, 
    optical atomic clocks are only just starting to leave the laboratory and get into the field.
    The inital motivation for creating this plot is to be used as a resource for those interested or 
    involved in precision timing and to keep track of the work being done 
    to package the very best clocks into a deployable form. 
</p>

<p class="text-block"> This plot shows where each clock sits in terms of its performance 
    (instability) vs its Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). 
    The lower the instability, the better the performance. The lower the SWaP, the more portable/deployable 
    the device.
    Unsurprisingly, the clocks with a larger SWaP also perform the best across all time scales. However for many real 
    world applications the very best performance is not necessary, this is where compromises can be made in order to 
    lower the SWaP of the device.
</p>

<p class="text-block"> Data for this plot has been sourced from the references provided, and where necessary 
    extra information has been obtained
    via communication with the researchers and/or manufacturers. 
</p>

<h2 id="sub-plots">Breaking down Size, Weight and Power vs Performance</h2>

<p class="text-block"> To make the true scale of SWaP more accessible the above plot can be broken down and plotted separately for each of the SWaP components: Size, weight and power. 
</p>

<p class="text-block"> 
    Here I have only plotted the 1 second ADEV for clarity. While the traces are slightly different for each metric, for the most part the clocks show the same distribution for each individual dimension of SWaP as they do for the overall combined SWaP. 
    The benefit of visualizing the clocks in this way allows the viewer to more easily 
    picture the scale of each metric and therefore the device. Individually the components of: cm<sup>3</sup>, kg and Watts are easier to relate to than the extremely large numbers associated with the SWaP units of cm<sup>3</sup>kgW.</p>


<p class="text-block"> One can swap between your preferred size units of cm<sup>3</sup> and litres, 
    and weight units of kg and pounds (lbs), using the sliders. </p>

<p class="text-block"> <strong>NOTE: the breakdown of SWaP for each clock may not be available, 
    so some clocks that appear on the main plot may not appear on these. Over time I hope to be able to fill in any missing data.</strong>
