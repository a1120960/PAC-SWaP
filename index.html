<h1 class="text-block" id="PAGE TITLE">Visualizing the SWaP and Performance of Portable Atomic Clocks</h1>




<p class="text-block"> 
   Precision timekeeping underpins almost all modern technologies, including navigation, communication network synchronization, financial transactions, and power grid management, among many others. Historically, advancements in precise timekeeping have paralleled almost all technological revolutions. Over the last 80 years, microwave atomic clocks, now essential to our infrastructure, have set the standard for atomic timing precision. This website will document the progress of next-generation optical atomic clocks as they move from the lab to practical applications. The main focus is on the immediate challenges to deploying portable atomic clocks, in particular, their Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements, and how these factors can influence clock performance and deployability.

<h2 id="main-plot">Cutting edge: SWaP vs Performance plot</h2>

<p class="text-block"> Atomic clocks are currently the best source of precision timekeeping. 
    Optical atomic clocks are the best atomic clocks, however up until very recently, have been confined to the laboratory. 
    Much work has been done to make atomic clocks portable. 
    While microwave atomic clocks have been packaged in a portable form for decades, 
    optical atomic clocks are only just starting to leave the laboratory and get into the field.
    The motivation for creating this plot is for it to be used as a resource for those interested and or 
    involved in precision timing, and helping to keep track of the work being done 
    to package high performance clocks into a deployable form. 
</p>

<p class="text-block"> The main focus is on the immediate challenges to deploying portable atomic clocks, namely, their size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements, and how these critical factors directly influence clock performance and deployability.
    Beyond this, there will be other considerations relating to the ability to manufacture at scale, cost, accuracy, reliability and other aspects of how clock specifications might meet various use-cases. However, with this resource we focus on the relationship between SWaP and frequency stability.

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The full SWaP plot. Clock performance - ADEV for 1s (coloured diamond), 1000s (grey square) or 10,000s (grey circle) - as a function of total system size, weight and power (cm<sup>3</sup>kgW). Dotted horizontal line shows performance indicative of GNSS timing at 1s.</p>

<p class="text-block"> <a href="#Fig1">Figure 1</a> is the full SWaP plot. This plot shows the performance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance"> (ADEV)</a> 
    of portable atomic clocks as a function of system Size, 
    Weight and Power (SWaP). Performance is shown for 1, 1000 and 10,000 second integration times (where available). 
    Hovering over a coloured 1s marker will reveal more information about the clock:
    Wether it is optical or microwave, commercial or research, its SWaP, its ADEV @ 1second, 
    the manufacturer and or research group, the atomic species, its physics package type and a reference number. This plot conveys all of the information about each clock in a single figure. Further down the page, in subsequent sections, I break the information up into simpler plots that help make some of the general trends more obvious. 
 </p>



<p class="text-block"> 
    In simple terms, the lower a clocks fractional frequency instability for a given integration time, the better the performance, and the lower the SWaP, the more portable (or deployable) the device.
    It should come as no surprise that the clocks with a larger SWaP also perform the best across all time scales, However for many real world applications the very best performance may not necessary. This is where compromises can be made which allow a reduction of the SWaP of the device. A truly disruptive device would be one which manages to break away from the general diagonal trend and appear in the direction of the lower left corner of the plot.

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Focussed SWaP plot. Performance as a function of SWaP, the focus is now on the region that is populated by devices that have a SWaP value between that of a Playstation and a family fridge. </p>

<p class="text-block"> In <a href="#Fig2">Figure 2</a> we are focused on the clustered region from the full SWaP plot. This is where most of the new devices are appearing. There are now many clocks with similar performance that have a SWaP ranging from that of a Playstation to that of the average sized family fridge. The expectation is this region of the plot will become much more congested in the future, as it represents the realistic trade-off between performance and SWaP a new generation of optical timing devices will target. 
</p>

<p class="text-block"> This highlights the differences in scale between the devices on the plot. One could imagine transporting something the size of a playstation around relatively easily, one person can carry it, but a device on the scale and scale of a fridge presents a different challenge. However, this may not be an issue depending on the application. Some applications might require a device that can be moved in and setup and left to run for an extended time. In which case the extra SWaP may not be an issue. Other applications may demand a device that can be easily moved and operated with minimal delay and setup time.

<h2 id="sub-plots">Breaking down Size, Weight and Power vs Performance</h2>

<p class="text-block"> The units of SWaP end up creating extremely large numbers, so make the true scale of a devices SWaP more accessible, the SWaP from the above plots can be broken down and plotted separately for each of the individual components: Size, Weight and Power. 
</p>

<iframe id = 'Fig3' src="SWAP-PLOT-SLIDERS.html" width="1000" height="650">
</iframe>
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Separately plotting the 1 second ADEV of each clock as a function of its Size, Weight and Power. Units for Size and Weight can be changed using the sliders below each plot </p>

<p class="text-block"> 
    For <a href="#Fig3">Figure 4</a> the 1 second ADEV vs each SWaP metric is plotted. While the traces are slightly different for each individual metric, for the most part the clocks show the same distribution for each dimension of SWaP as they do for the total SWaP value. The benefit of visualizing the clocks in this way allows the viewer to more easily picture the scale of each metric and therefore the device. Individually the components of: cm<sup>3</sup>, kg and Watts are easier to relate to than the extremely large numbers associated with the SWaP units of cm<sup>3</sup>kgW.</p>

<p class="text-block"> You can switch between preferred size units of cm<sup>3</sup> and litres, and weight units of kg and pounds (lbs), using the sliders underneath each plot. </p>

<p class="text-block"> <strong>NOTE: the breakdown of SWaP for each clock may not be available, 
    so some clocks that appear on the main plot may not appear in <a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>. Over time I hope to be able to fill in any of the missing data.</strong>

<h2 id = "commercial">Commercial high performance clocks: SWaP & performance</h2>


<p class="text-block"> This section details the SWaP and performance of currently available commercial atomic clocks. This selection of clocks is inspired by table 1, on page 8 of the <a href="https://eprintspublications.npl.co.uk/9987/"> NPL holdover atomic clock landscape review.</a> This list of clocks includes some overlap with devices in the previous sections, as well as the addition of crystal oscillators.

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Performance at 1sec integration time as a function of device SWaP for commercially available clocks. Clocks are color coded according to categories defined in the original NPL document. Hovering over a marker will reveal more information about each device, including the technology the clock is based on, and performance at longer integration times.<a href="#Fig_commercial"> Figure 6</a> provides more detail on each clocks performance. </p>

<p class="text-block">
    <a href="#Fig_commercial_swap">Figure 5</a> is of the same style as the previous SWaP plots. Here we look specifically at commercially available devices inspired by the NPL document. The data demonstrates the same trend as the previous plots. the ADEV for 1sec integration times improves as the SWaP of the device increases. The data points lack text labels as the number of devices makes any attempt at labelling illegible. There are also some devices which may occupy the same point on the plot. In order to resolve all of the devices one will need to zoom in on areas that are congested and use the hover function. In general the 'Strategic' clocks have the best performance, at the cost of additional SWaP, and conversely the low SWaP 'chip-scale' devices have lesser performance. We refer the reader to the <a href="https://eprintspublications.npl.co.uk/9987/">original NPL document</a> for more detail regarding the determination of clock category.</p>

<p class="text-block">The 1 second ADEV doesn't describe the whole picture of commercial clock performance. Thankfully as these are commercial devices, spec sheets with data are readily available, allowing us to visualize the performance of each clock over longer integration times.</p>

<p class="text-block"> 
    <a href="#Fig_commercial">Figure 6</a> shows the fractional frequency stability for commercially available atomic clocks. Please refer to the original document for more information on the determination of clock categories. The focus on this plot is performance, however the SWaP for each clock is available by hovering over a marker. </p>

<p class="text-block"> 
    This section is a work in progress. I will be adding the source data (as a csv) and code used to create this plot soon. At this point I don't offer a reference list, however the data sheet for each clock listed can be easily found by searching the clock name in the legend (which is how i compiled the data). </p>

<p class="text-block"> 
    I will also be adding this collection of commercial clocks to the main swap plot - Once i can work out a sensible way to display everything without it looking like a mess. </p>

<div class="text-block">
    <p>I am including this so that both the performance of all clocks can be compared. The plot itself is very messy and with so much overlap it can be difficult to read. The number of devices means that the legend is taller than the plot making it difficult to fit on screen without having to scroll through the legend. I will try to improve the readability of this plot over time. </p>
